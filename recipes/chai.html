    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chai is a drink that millions of Indians have everyday and love it.
        It is rich, milky and full of flavour that is an utter delight to have.
        May be served with or without sugar according to preference.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Tea Lives</li>
        <li>Optional Spices</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring water, milk and spices to a simmer in a small saucepan on the stove (adding the spices from the start gives them plenty of time to infuse).</li>
        <li>Reduce heat and add in black tea to brew.</li>
        <li>Wait for tea to steep (don’t boil it at this point or the tea releases too many tannins – those bitter compounds that make your mouth feel dry).</li>
        <li>Strain the warm spiced mixture into a mug; this will hold back the whole spices and tea leaves.</li>
        <li>Stir sugar into your chai and sweeten to taste.</li>
    </ol>
