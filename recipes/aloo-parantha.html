    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This potato stuffed flatbread is a popular Indian breakfast that combines two of my favorite starches in a single delectable package. Crisp on the outside and tender on the inside, this humble meal is as comforting as a hug.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Making the Potato Stuffing</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, boil or steam 4 medium-sized potatoes in a pressure cooker, steamer or electric cooker. Add enough water in a 2-litre pressure cooker or pan to just barely cover the potatoes.</li>
        <li>If you haven’t done so yet, peel and chop the warm potatoes. Then mash the potatoes with a potato masher.If you don’t have a potato masher, use a box grater to grate them and then mash the potatoes with a fork.</li>
        <li>The potatoes should be mashed very well, with no lumps, chunks or bits. Any lumps in the mix will cause the stuffing to leak out of the dough when rolling.</li>
        <li> Now add the following ingredients, feeling free to vary the spices as you like.
            <ul>
                <li>½ to 1 teaspoon finely chopped green chillies (1 to 2 green chilies) or serrano peppers</li>
                <li>¼ to ½ teaspoon punjabi garam masala powder or Garam Masala Powder</li>
                <li>¼ to ½ teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder or cayenne pepper or paprika (optional)</li>
                <li>½ to 1 teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur powder) – or use lemon juice instead</li>
                <li>salt according to your taste</li>
            </ul>

        </li>
        <li>With a spoon, thoroughly mix the ground spices and green chilies into the mashed potatoes to get an even mixture. Set the prepared aloo stuffing aside.</li>
        
    </ol>
    <h3>Making the dough</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a separate bowl, add 2 cups whole wheat flour (atta). Make a well in the center. Add ½ teaspoon salt (or to taste), 1 tablespoon oil or ghee, and roughly ⅓ to ½ cup water.</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture together and knead into a smooth, soft dough for 8 to 10 minutes. Add more water if needed. Cover and keep the dough aside, letting it rest for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        
    </ol>
    <h3>Stuffing the flatbread</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pinch off a medium ball of dough. Roll it between your palms and lightly flatten it. Dust with some flour and roll to a circle about 5 to 5.5 inches diameter.Place the potato stuffing in the center, keeping about 2 to 2.5 inches of space from the sides.</li>
        <li>Take the edge and start pleating, joining the pleats in the center.</li>
        <li>When all of the pleats are joined together, it should look like a Chinese dumpling. Be sure to pinch the pleats together very well so the filling doesn’t leak out while rolling.</li>
        <li> Press the joined top portion slightly downward to flatten it a bit.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle some flour and roll this version of stuffed paratha to about the same size as that of a chapati or roti. If some of the filling comes out, then just take a small piece of dough and cover the gap.Roll, trying to create the same thickness throughout, as you would a pie dough. Avoid keeping the edges thick.</li>

    </ol>
    <h3>Roasting</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>On a hot tawa (skillet or griddle), place the rolled paratha. The tawa should be quite hot; cooking parathas at a low flame will harden them. Ideally, the finished parathas are crisp as well as soft.</li>
        <li>When the base is partly cooked, flip the paratha using a spatula. You will see some air pockets on this side.</li>
        <li> Spread some ghee or a neutral flavored oil (e.g. sunflower) on the partly cooked part.</li>
        <li>Flip again and you will see nice golden blisters on the second side. To clarify, the side which has been spread with ghee will be on the bottom.This side has to be cooked more than the previous side.</li>
        <li>Spread some ghee on the second side facing you. A well-made and well-roasted alu paratha will always puff up when roasting.</li>
        <li>Flip again once or twice till both sides are cooked properly, with crisp brown spots. You should also press the alu paratha edges down with a spatula or spoon so that they are fried well. Repeat, making all parathas this way.</li>
    </ol>
